        I read a lot. Whether from Twitter, newsletters, HackerNews, or
        conferences - a large percentage of my life is spent drinking from the
        information firehose that is the internet. A lot of what I find, I
        categorize and store for the future. That said, I&#39;ve been doing this
        for years, and much of what I&#39;ve indexed lies unfindable in my
        Chrome bookmarks. This is the problem this site is intended to fix.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to providing a public, searchable index of my bookmarks, I
        also wanted to build a better way of categorizing them. With the nature
        of bookmarks, the only real categorizing you can do is with a lot of
        nested folder. Rather than follow that paradigm, this site allows me to
        tag each link as well, adding a layer of knowledge and discoverability
        that I have been missing.
